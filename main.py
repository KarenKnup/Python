print("Welcome")

Python is one of the most popular and useful coding languages. It has a simple syntax which means itâ€™s easy to write, read and learn!

Humans use code to give instructions to machines. The print() instruction is the easiest way to send a message to the screen or other display device.

Numbers donâ€™t require quotation marks

print(360)

ðŸŒŸhumans use code to give instructions to machines
ðŸŒŸ the print() instruction displays a message on the screen.

Computer programs use variables to remember important information, like items in a shopping cart, prices and discounts.

The line of code below tells the computer to store information in a variable called item.
item = "bike" //variÃ¡vel item
	variable name: item
	variable value: "bike"

A large amount of information out there consists of text. A piece of text data is called a string.

In this lesson, youâ€™ll work with text data.

Strings in Python need to be surrounded by quotation marks.

Create a valid Python string

"The Lord of the Rings"

Complete the line of code to store the value "Apple" in the variable

company = "Apple"

In Python, both single ' and double " quotes can be used to define strings. It doesnâ€™t make a difference whether you choose double or single quotation marks.
month = 'April'

The code in computer programs is made of statements. Statements are the instructions for the computer to follow. Real programs can contain thousands of statements.

What's the number of statements in this code? //2
book = "Harry Potter"
author = "J. K. Rowling"

Numerical data is information that comes in the form of numbers.
In this lesson, you'll learn how to deal with numerical data in your computer programs.

Numerical values can be directly stored in variables.

Complete the code below:
population = 25000

You can send a number to the screen with the print() statement. You just need to insert the number between the parentheses.
print(280)

You can perform math operations with numbers. Each print() instruction will add a value to the screen in a new line.
print(7 + 3)
print(10 - 5)
print(5 * 3)
print(10 / 2)

Variables are key to software development. They allow you to store, label and play with data.

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn to work with data that has been stored in variables.

You can update the value stored in a variable. The variable will forget the previously stored value.
price = 99
price = 100
print(price)
